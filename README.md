## 🎯 Project Aim
To develop an **interactive AR furniture visualization system** using Unity and AR Foundation that enables users to:
- View 3D models of furniture in their surroundings through their mobile camera.
- Interact with objects (rotate, zoom, place).
- Experience realistic textures and dimensions for better decision-making before purchase.

## 📅 Week 3 (23 Oct – 29 Oct 2025)

#### ✅ **Key Accomplishments**
- Successfully tested **AR object placement** on a physical surface using the mobile device.  
- Verified accurate **plane detection** and realistic object scaling through AR Foundation.  
- Tested furniture models’ appearance in real-world lighting using the **AR Camera** on Android.  
- Fixed anchor stability issues and ensured the 3D models remained properly positioned after camera movement.  
- Captured the **first live AR test** (object placed in user environment).  

#### 🎯 **Goals for Next Week**
