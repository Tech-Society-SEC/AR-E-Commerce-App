# 🪑 AR-Ecommerce-App
An AR-based furniture visualization app built in Unity that allows users to view 3D furniture models in augmented reality before purchasing.

---

## 🎯 Project Aim
To develop an **interactive AR furniture visualization system** using Unity and AR Foundation that enables users to:
- View 3D models of furniture in their surroundings through their mobile camera.
- Interact with objects (rotate, zoom, place).
- Experience realistic textures and dimensions for better decision-making before purchase.
